    "There are a number of things that The Ministry of Economic Development and Tourism of Chile should focus on to improve the existing tourism and further enhance the industry. First,  Focusing on Tourism Mobility and Transportation Infrastructure is extremely important because this dimension is one of the fundamentals of well establisihed tourism industry. In addition, this dimension also can enhance the regions which do not see much tourism. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another dimension that the goverment of Chile should focus on is HR and Tourism Related Work Development. In our ever-changing world, especially post the COVID times, its important to adjust your tourism strategy to accomodate the new way of living. To elaborate, many people are working from home and can technically work from any spot. One of the things is people travelling and working at coffee shops and local areas. With that comes spending time around the towns they visit. Thus, its important to have strong hiring strategies with great customer service such that tourists have a smooth experience when visiting these regions in Chile. In addition, its important to have good policing and safety in those regions so that tourists do not feel threatned to walk around or visit these areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the Ministry of Economic Development and Tourism should focus on Tourism Infrastructure espescially for regions are were ranked pretty low that have tourism activity. This basically covers elements like roads, railways, airports, and the like, which make a tourist destination accessible for tourists. Tourism Infrastructure Readiness is a measurable factor that is studied by various institutions. Thus, it's critical for a country to have a well established tourism infrastructure because there's a saying by the World Economic Forum \"If you build it, they will come\" and its basically about why infrastructure is crucial to tourism growth and competitiveness. \n"
